Twelve hundred miles times $6.5 million equals $7.8 billion to wall off Texas. (It's exactly&nbsp;the sum Trump requested for immediate aid in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.)&nbsp;But that figure, too, is bogus:&nbsp;We cannot extrapolate the price per mile for a wall based on what it cost to built fences. This is what we know:</p><ul>
	<li>A wall almost certainly will be more expensive than<strong> a</strong> fence due to its height, volume and engineering.</li>
	<li>There are no details. <strong></strong> While federal officials have selected contractors to build prototypes, no actual designs had been released by the time of our journey.&nbsp;To date, the president has said his wall should be at least 40 feet, or at least 30 feet, or no less than 20 feet.</li>
	<li>GAO fence calculations did not include land acquisition, litigation, and utility relocation costs. Those expenses figure to be huge, especially in Texas.</li>
	<li>The existing fencing was built in relatively easy and inexpensive locations (less eminent domain and easier access, topography, etc.) If those barriers are ripped out for replacement by a wall, it will add cost. As more difficult locations are chosen, costs will escalate.</li>
</ul><p>We have seen a dizzying array of price estimates for a wall project,&nbsp;from Trump projections as low as $4 billion to Democrats saying $60 billion. Yet no one even knows how many miles of wall will be built, in what locations, using what design.</p><p>Still, for the sake of discussion, $10 million per mile might be a ballpark estimate in difficult terrain.</p><p>The area in question is part of the Border Patrol’s Big Bend Sector, formerly known as the Marfa Sector, with 510 miles of border.</p><p>&nbsp;The Big Bend Sector had just 6,366 apprehensions&nbsp;last year —&nbsp;less than 2 percent of the total.&nbsp;That's&nbsp;about 12 migrants per mile of border.</p><p>The problem is so marginal that National Park rangers, rather than Border Patrol agents, handle most enforcement efforts.</p><p>If a $10 million mile of wall could reduce the number of illegal entries by half — from 12 to six&nbsp;— that would be nearly $1.7 million per migrant turned away.</p><p>Ask the White House or Department of Homeland Security for the mile-by-mile analyses. There are none. (The Trump administration declined interview requests for this story.)&nbsp;In fact, a Government Accountability Office report found that Customs and Border Protection never even calculated the effectiveness of&nbsp;existing barriers.</p><p>President Donald Trump has been emphatic that current fences are not enough: “A wall is better than fencing, and it’s much more powerful. It’s more secure. It’s taller.”</p><p>But during April 5 testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland and Security and Governmental Affairs, <strong> Homeland Security&nbsp;</strong>Secretary John Kelly could not describe the wall. “There is no way I can give the committee an estimate of how much this will cost,” he said. “I mean, I don’t know what it will be made of, I don’t know how high it will be, I don’t know if it will have solar panels…”</p><p>The president’s executive order of Jan. 25 specified only that the wall and accompanying staffing<strong>&nbsp;</strong>must be formidable enough “to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism.”</p><p>The order called for a “comprehensive study” to be completed within 180 days. It mandated a “strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control” of the international boundary.</p><p>Congress has defined “operational control” as “the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States.”</p><p>By that standard, the wall is guaranteed to fail.</p><p>The 180-day deadline expired in July. No analyses have been made public.</p><p>On the outskirts of Big Bend, the river is a deep canyon. As we pass above, a handful of canoes stall on a shoal at midstream. The Rio Grande is so shallow the passengers have to get out and push, then jump back in to paddle. Cattle stare from the shore.</p><p>We rise into Big Bend National Park, where the Chisos Mountains loom thousands of feet higher. Cliffs on the Mexican side are layered pink, orange and gray.</p><p>There was, of course, that key rejoinder to the campaign rallying cry: “And Mexico is going to pay for it.”</p><p>Mexican officials immediately vowed there would be no such financing. After his inauguration, Trump suggested such payment might be extracted by extension&nbsp;through a 20 percent tariff on Mexican imports. Or changes in NAFTA? Or money seized from drug kingpins?</p><p>Other proposals have percolated, including that idea of a self-funding wall of solar panels. Analysts suggest the revenue would be nowhere near the costs.&nbsp;</p><p>Whoever pays for it, the wall's cost will shrink if Trump’s promise keeps shrinking. After calling for a wall all along the border, his campaign backed down in October to just 1,000 miles.</p><p>Then, in July, Trump lowered the threshold to just 700 miles.&nbsp;</p><p>"You have mountains,” he explained to reporters aboard Air Force One. "You have some rivers that are violent and vicious. You have some areas that are so far away that you don't really have people crossing. So you don't need that."&nbsp;</p><p>The president again did not specify whether he counts existing barriers toward that goal. However, he leaned more toward including the fence.</p><p>Seemingly referring to ongoing border-fence construction that upgrades some Secure Fence Act sections, he said, “We've already started the wall because we're fixing large portions of wall right now.”&nbsp;</p><p>So, if the fence is a wall after all, and only 700 miles is needed, and the border currently has 654 miles of barriers … Is it possible the country could build 46 miles of wall and declare victory?&nbsp;</p></div></div></section>
